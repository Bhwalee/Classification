Based on given data, few conclusions can be drawn by analyzing which feature helps to detect if a patient has heart disease. 

According to men's graph, I was able to differentiate based on three features - age, blood pressure, heart rate. 

A clear seperation occurred for age, and medium seperation occurred blood pressure, and heart rate. 

Based on these findings, I hope to implment same model for women.
