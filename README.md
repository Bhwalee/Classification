# Classification

For this project, I would like to build a model which decides customer loan apporval. Based on customer's ability to replay the loans and their ability to pay the debt in time, it would be helpful to figure out which customers delay the payment of loan or unable to play the loans due to financial status. I will be using supervised / logisitc regression to determine and predict the loan repayment status. 

By making this model, banks will be able to identify who will be able to apply for loans and how much they could apply for. 

The aim from the project is to make use of pandas, matplotlib, & seaborn libraries from python to extract insights from the data and scikit-learn libraries for machine learning.

Secondly, to learn how to hypertune the parameters using grid search cross validation for the machine learning model.

And in the end, to predict whether the loan applicant can replay the loan or not using voting ensembling techniques of combining the predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms.

Some attributes in the dataset includes - Loan id, Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self Employed, Applicant income, Coapplicant income, Loan Amount,Credit History, Property_Area, Loan_Status
