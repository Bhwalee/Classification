# Classification

For this project, I would like to build a model that decides whether a patient may be diagnosed with diabetes. Based on the patient's health factors such as glucose, heart rate, blood pressure...etc, it would be helpful to figure out which factors determine high risks of diabetes. I will be using supervised / logisitc regression to determine and predict diabetes.

By making this model, doctors can easily find out which patient might be diagnosed with diabetes.

The aim from the project is to make use of pandas, matplotlib, & seaborn libraries from python to extract insights from the data and scikit-learn libraries for machine learning.

Secondly, learn how to hypertune the parameters using grid search cross validation for the machine learning model.

In the end, determine which classification model best predict a patient's status using performance metrics.

Some attributes in the dataset includes - glucose, BMI, pregnancies, age, blood pressure, insulin, and skin thickness.
