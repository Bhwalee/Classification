# Predicting Diabetes

# Abstract
For the classification project, I wanted to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes based on their diagnostic medical measurement. Dataset is given 8 different features such as glucose, blood level, BMI...etc. Based on these features, leveraging many classification we have learned in class, I would like to make a model that optimizes precision and accuracy based on F1 score by exploring various models and determine which feature has an impact in predicting diabetes

# Design
Datasets are found in Kaggle. It has 8 different features and, based on these medical diagnostic measurements, I would like to correctly predict how many patients are diagnosed with diabetes. Trying different classification models, I would like to compare and explore which model works the best and which model retains most precision and recall. 

# Data
8 different features are given in medical measurements and about 700 rows are present. 

# Algorithm
Using classification models we learned during class, I wanted to pick the model based on strong cross-validation model. Strong feature - outcome relation shows which feature to focus on and what needs to be tweaked in order to get higher F1 score. I specifically focused on revamping Recall score because that is what correctly guesses from the total dataset.
